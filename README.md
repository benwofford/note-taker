This project's purpose is to create notes to organize a busy mind.

You can access the github repository here: https://github.com/benwofford/note-taker

The heroku deployment can be found here: https://stark-hollows-89499.herokuapp.com/
(This Heroku deployment is currently experiencing technical difficulties.)

(As a backup until I can find the problem with Heroku, here is the deployment on Github pages: https://benwofford.github.io/note-taker/)

## Build Status ##

Everything works except for the delete function. Still tweaking that.
